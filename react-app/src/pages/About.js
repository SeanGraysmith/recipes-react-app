                <h2>About this Website and Myself</h2>

                <p>I am building this website to create a place to store my favorite recipes for the public to see. I am focusing on recipes that are affordable, fun, and quick to make. Additionally, I want to promote beginners to learn more about cooking, as it is an essential skill for everyone. </p>
                <p>I am a university student who enjoys cooking as much as I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. I hope that my recipes can reach a broad audience and convince others to learn how to spread love through food. </p>

                                                        basics like pasta and simple proteins. My personal favorite is experimenting with different forms of cooking eggs." />

                <Question questionQ="Q: What tools do I need to start cooking?" questionA="You only need a simple pot and frying pan to make the majority of recipes on this website.
                                         Any sharp knife will do for beginners, just be careful and take your time. I would also recommend using a bamboo cutting board and a wooden cooking spoon." />
